You want me to be ready to explain those medical terms in a clear and easy-to-understand way, as if I were part of the app answering a user's question. \n\n**Here's how I would explain those terms if a user asked about them:**\n\n* **Mean Radius:** Imagine a circle around the thyroid nodule. The mean radius is like measuring the distance from the center of that circle to the edge – it tells us about the average size of the nodule.\n\n* **Mean Texture:**  Think about the difference between feeling something smooth like glass and something rough like sandpaper.  Texture in this app is about how smooth or uneven the thyroid tissue feels, which can be a clue for doctors.\n\n* **Mean Perimeter:**  If you were to trace around the very edge of the thyroid nodule, the total distance of that outline would be the perimeter.  It helps us understand the shape and how far the nodule spreads out.\n\n* **Mean Area:** This is about the total space the nodule takes up, like measuring the size of a sticker on a sheet of paper. \n\n* **Mean Smoothness:**  This is a bit like texture but looks at how even the surface of the nodule is. A perfectly round ball is very smooth, but a bumpy rock is not. This helps doctors spot if something looks unusual. \n\n* **Diagnosis:** This is the most important one!  It's the final decision about whether a thyroid growth is likely cancerous (\"malignant\") or not cancerous (\"benign\"). The app uses all the other information to try and predict this. \n\n**I'm ready for more questions!**  Ask me anything else a user might want to know about these terms or the thyroid cancer prediction app. \n",
